This Tic-Tac-Toe game is the second game I started working on during this project. I realized half way through that my first project was too complex for my current skill set, however, I still plan on finishing it throughout the class as I learn more. It was also tough because I created a new game that was never made before, so it was hard to find examples to reference online. I hope you enjoy this Tic-Tac-Toe classic!
